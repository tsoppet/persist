# Persist
An exploration of Reading/Writing and Cryptography in GoLang.

Most code in this package was taken from 
[Mat Ryer's Medium Article](https://medium.com/@matryer/golang-advent-calendar-day-eleven-persisting-go-objects-to-disk-7caf1ee3d11d) and
[Nic Raboy's AES Crypto Post](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/02/encrypt-decrypt-data-golang-application-crypto-packages/) @ [ThePoliglotDeveloper.com](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com)
and [Moisoto's Crypt Library](https://github.com/moisoto/crypt) which I discovered after reading Nic Raboy's AES Crypto post.
